# web-scrapping-project
I have made a Python script which checks into https://www.newegg.ca/ website (an e-commerce store) for a specific product of your wish that is in stock and displays the list of the products sorted in ascending order regarding the price, for you to pick the cheapest one. The example is based on a Graphics Card product, but the program works for all of the products available on this website.
Made with Beautiful Soup 4 and Requests.
